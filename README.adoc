= Rust Russian Roulette Simulator

== Overview
The Rust Russian Roulette Simulator is a CLI-based simulation of the infamous game of Russian Roulette, written in Rust. Players can configure the game via command-line arguments or interactively within the program. The game ends when either only one player is left alive or there are no more bullets left.

== Features
* Configurable cylinder sequence or random generation.
* Multiple spin modes for the revolver.
* Interactive player configuration.

== Usage

=== Command-line Arguments
The simulator accepts various command-line arguments to configure the game. Below is a description of the available options:

==== Cylinder Data
`--cylinder_sequence` (`-c`)
* Provide an explicit cylinder sequence as a string, e.g., `001001`.
* This specifies the exact placement of bullets in the cylinder.

`--cylinder_capacity` (`-C`)
* Provide the capacity for a randomly generated cylinder.
* Specify the number of chambers (e.g., 6).

NOTE: The `--cylinder_sequence` and `--cylinder_capacity` options are mutually exclusive. You can provide either one or none, but not both.

==== Spin Mode
`--spin_mode` (`-s`)
* Select the spin mode for the cylinder. Available values:
  - `NoSpin`: Do not spin the cylinder.
  - `Spin`: Perform a single spin before starting the game.
  - `SpinBeforeShot`: Spin the cylinder before each shot.

==== Player Configuration File
`--player_conf_file` (`-p`)
* Provide the location of a player configuration file.
* This file defines the players and their details for the game.

=== Example Usage
1. Specify a predefined cylinder sequence:
```bash
roulette_simulator -c "001001" -s Spin -p players.txt
```

2. Use a random cylinder with a specified capacity:
```bash
roulette_simulator -C 6 -s SpinBeforeShot -p players.txt
```

3. Run interactively without predefined configurations:
```bash
roulette_simulator
```

== Game Rules
1. The game simulates Russian Roulette.
2. Players take turns pulling the trigger of a revolver.
3. The game ends when:
   * Only one player is left alive.
   * The cylinder runs out of bullets.

== Interactive Mode
If no configuration is provided via command-line arguments, the simulator will prompt the user interactively to:
* Set up players.
* Define the cylinder sequence or capacity.
* Choose the spin mode.

== Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the simulator.
